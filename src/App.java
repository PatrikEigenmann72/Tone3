 * App.java -  The App class serves as the entry point for the application. When

 * from the command line—the system needs a defined starting point. This class
 * provides that by containing the main method.
 *
 * The main method is where execution begins, initializing necessary components and
 * setting the application into motion. It ensures that the first frame, user
 * interface, and core functionality are properly instantiated.
 *
 * In a structured software environment, every project needs a single place where
 * the system knows to start. This class fulfills that role, keeping the application
 * streamlined and predictable across multiple use cases.

     * The main method acts as the starting point of the application. When the program
     * is launched, execution begins here, ensuring that all necessary components are
     * initialized and the user interface is displayed.
     *
     * This method is responsible for setting the application in motion. It ensures
     * that the primary frame is created and rendered within the correct thread
     * context to maintain responsiveness and stability.
     *
     * In structured software design, having a clearly defined entry point allows for
     * predictable execution, making the application easy to manage and extend.
     *
     * @param args Command-line arguments passed during application startup.
     *             These can be used for configuration or debugging but are
     *             typically not required in standard executions.
